# Serverless-Audio-Video-Chatbot

In simple terms, this project is like having a virtual assistant for students. People can upload their lecture audios or videos, and then chat about those files as if they were talking to a friend. OpenAI's Whisper transcribes those audios/videos and stores them in a persistent database. This becomes the knowledge base that people can ask questions about. It's like having a study buddy who never forgets anything from the lectures!
